# `task-triangle`

Find the minimal cost path through a triangle.

Note: the code for this task was written in 2011, before Java 8 was released, so there is some code
that could be refactored to better use newer Java language features such as `Math.addExact`,
`record`s, streams and lambdas, etc. I have only updated the build script to Gradle and applied a
standard formatting to the Java code.

Identical problems have been published since at least 2013 on *LeetCode* (see
[120. Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle/))
and as part of the popular publicly-available *4clojure* problems (see
[Problem 79, Triangle Minimal Path](https://4clojure.oxal.org/#/problem/79)).
So please consider this code repository to be a Java 7 solution to those specific publicly-available
coding problems.
