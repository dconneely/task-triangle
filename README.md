# `task-triangle`

Find the minimal cost path through a triangle.

Note: the code for this task was written in 2011, before Java 8 was released,
so there will be code that could be refactored to use newer language features.

Identical problems have been published since at least 2013 on *LeetCode* (see
[120 Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle/)) and as part of the
popular publicly-available *4clojure* problems (see
[4ever-clojure](https://4clojure.oxal.org/#/problem/79) or
[4bb](https://github.com/bobbicodes/4bb/blob/0fea206398b0a857c66cda8faee966755dcf1127/problems.clj#L779-L789)),
so please consider this code repository to be a Java 7 solution to those
specific publicly-available coding problems.
