# `task-triangle`

Find the minimal cost path through a triangle.

Note: the code for this task was written in 2011, before Java 8 was released,
so there may be code that could be refactored to use newer language features.

An identical problem has been published since at least 2015 as part of the
popular publicly-available *4clojure* problem set (see
[4ever-clojure](https://4clojure.oxal.org/#/problem/79) or
[4bb](https://github.com/bobbicodes/4bb/blob/0fea206398b0a857c66cda8faee966755dcf1127/problems.clj#L779-L789)),
so please consider this code repository to be a Java solution to that specific
publicly-available coding problem.
